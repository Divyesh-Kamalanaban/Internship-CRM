### **Robust Backend Infrastructure**
The backbone of this application is a scalable and secure backend. We've used **Express.js** to build a powerful RESTful API and **MongoDB** for a flexible, high-performance database. This combination ensures **seamless CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete), providing a reliable foundation for all data interactions.

### **Workflow Automation & Efficiency**
To significantly enhance user experience and productivity, we've integrated **on-demand file generation** across all modules. Users can instantly create and download essential documents like PDFs of estimates, invoices, and credit notes. This automation eliminates manual work and streamlines the entire business workflow.
